## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- No additional dependencies required!

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/modern-calculator.git
   cd modern-calculator
   ```

2. **Open in browser**
   ```bash
   # Simply open index.html in your browser
   open index.html
   
   # Or serve with a local server
   python -m http.server 8000

## 💡 Usage Examples

### Basic Calculations
```
2 + 3 × 4 = 14
(15 + 25) ÷ 8 = 5
```

### Scientific Functions
```
sin(π/2) = 1
log(100) = 2
√(64) = 8
```

### Graphing
```
Enter equations like:
- x^2 (parabola)
- sin(x) (sine wave)  
- log(x) (logarithmic curve)
```
